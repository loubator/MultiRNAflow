DEanalysisGlobal(
  SEres,
  pval.min = 0.05,
  pval.vect.t = NULL,

}
\arguments{
\item{SEres}{Results of the function
\code{\link[=DATAprepSE]{DATAprepSE()}}.}

\item{pval.min}{Numeric value between 0 and 1. A gene will be considered as
differentially expressed (DE) between two biological conditions if
its Benjamini-Hochberg adjusted p-value
(see \code{\link[stats:p.adjust]{stats::p.adjust()}})
is below the threshold \code{pval.min}. Default value is 0.05.}

\item{pval.vect.t}{\code{NULL} or vector of dimension \eqn{T-1} filled with
numeric values between 0 and 1, with \eqn{T} the number of
time measurements.
A gene will be considered as differentially expressed (DE) between
the time ti and the reference time t0 if its Benjamini-Hochberg adjusted
p-value (see \code{\link[stats:p.adjust]{stats::p.adjust()}})
is below the i-th threshold of \code{pval.vect.t}.
If \code{NULL}, \code{pval.vect.t} will be vector of dimension \eqn{T-1}
filled with \code{pval.min}.}

\item{log.FC.min}{Non negative numeric value.
If the \eqn{log_2} fold change between biological conditions or times
has an absolute value below the threshold \code{log.FC.min},
then the gene is not selected even if is considered as DE.
Default value is 1.
If \code{log.FC.min=0}, all DE genes will be kept.}

\item{LRT.supp.info}{\code{TRUE} or \code{FALSE}.
If \code{TRUE}, the algorithm realizes another statistical test in order to
detect if, among all biological conditions and/or times,
at least one has a different behavior than the others
(see the input \code{test} in \code{\link[DESeq2:DESeq]{DESeq2::DESeq()}}).}

\item{Plot.DE.graph}{\code{TRUE} or \code{FALSE}. \code{TRUE} as default.
If \code{TRUE}, all graphs will be plotted.
Otherwise no graph will be plotted.}

\item{path.result}{Character or \code{NULL}. Path to save all results.
If \code{path.result} contains a sub folder entitled
"DEanalysis_\code{Name.folder.DE}" all results will be saved in
the sub folder "DEanalysis_\code{Name.folder.DE}".
Otherwise, a sub folder entitled "DEanalysis_\code{Name.folder.DE}"
will be created in \code{path.result} and all results will be saved in
"DEanalysis_\code{Name.folder.DE}".
If \code{NULL}, the results will not be saved in a folder.
\code{NULL} as default.}

\item{Name.folder.DE}{Character or \code{NULL}.
If \code{Name.folder.DE} is a character, the folder names which will
contain all results will be "DEanalysis_\code{Name.folder.DE}".
Otherwise, the folder name will be "DEanalysis".}

\value{
The function \code{\link[=DEanalysisGlobal]{DEanalysisGlobal()}}
returns first the raw counts and
the rle normalized data automatically realized by
\code{\link[DESeq2:DESeq]{DESeq2::DESeq()}}
(output \code{RLEdata}). Then
\itemize{
\item If samples belong to different biological conditions,
the function returns
\itemize{
\item a data.frame (output \code{DE.results}) which contains
\itemize{
\item pvalues, log2 fold change and DE genes between each pairs of
biological conditions.
\item a binary column (1 and 0) where 1 means the gene is DE between
at least one pair of biological conditions.
\item \eqn{N_{bc}} binary columns,
where \eqn{N_{bc}} is the number of biological conditions,
which gives the specific genes for each biological condition.
A '1' in one of these columns means the gene is specific to
the biological condition associated to the given column. 0 otherwise.
A gene is called specific to a given biological condition BC1,
if the gene is DE between BC1 and any other biological conditions,
but not DE between any pair of other biological conditions.
\item \eqn{N_{bc}} columns filled with -1, 0 and 1, one per biological
condition.
A '1' in one of these columns means the gene is up-regulated
(or over-expressed) for the biological condition associated to the
given column.
A gene is called up-regulated for a given biological condition BC1 if
the gene is specific to the biological condition BC1 and expressions
in BC1 are higher than in the other biological conditions.
A '-1' in one of these columns means the gene is down-regulated
(or under-expressed) for the biological condition associated to the
given column.
A gene is called down-regulated for a given biological condition BC1 if
the gene is specific to the biological condition BC1 and expressions
in BC1 are lower than in the other biological conditions.
A '0' in one of these columns means the gene is not specific to the
biological condition associated to the given column.
}
\item an UpSet plot (Venn diagram displayed as a barplot) which gives the
number of genes for each possible intersection
(see \code{\link[=DEplotVennBarplotGroup]{DEplotVennBarplotGroup()}}).
We consider that a set of pairs of biological conditions forms an
intersection if there is at least one gene which is DE for each of these
pairs of biological conditions, but not for the others.
\item a barplot which gives the number of genes categorized as "Upregulated"
and "DownRugulated", per biological condition
(see \code{\link[=DEplotBarplot]{DEplotBarplot()}}).
\item a barplot which gives the number of genes categorized as "Upregulated",
"DownRugulated" and "Other", per biological condition
(see \code{\link[=DEplotBarplot]{DEplotBarplot()}}).
A gene is categorized as 'Other', for a given biological condition,
if the gene is not specific to the given biological condition.
So this barplot, only plotted when there are strictly more than two
biological conditions, is similar to the previous barplot but with
the category "Other".
\item a list (output \code{List.Glossary}) containing the glossary of
the column names of \code{DE.results}.
\item a list (output \code{Summary.Inputs}) containing a summary of sample
information and inputs of
\code{\link[=DEanalysisGlobal]{DEanalysisGlobal()}}.
}
\item If data belong to different time points only, the function returns
\itemize{
\item a data.frame (output \code{Results}) which contains
\itemize{
\item gene names
\item pvalues, log2 fold change and DE genes between each time ti versus
the reference time t0.
\item a binary column (1 and 0) where 1 means the gene is DE at at least
between one time ti versus the reference time t0.
\item a column where each element is succession of 0 and 1.
The positions of '1' indicate the set of times ti such that the gene
is DE between ti and the reference time t0.

(see \code{\link[=DEplotAlluvial]{DEplotAlluvial()}})
\item a graph showing the number of DE genes as a function of time for
each temporal group
(see \code{\link[=DEplotAlluvial]{DEplotAlluvial()}}).
By temporal group, we mean the sets of genes which are first DE at
the same time.
\item a barplot which gives the number of DE genes per time
(see \code{\link[=DEplotBarplotTime]{DEplotBarplotTime()}})
\item an UpSet plot which gives the number of genes per temporal pattern
(see \code{\link[=DEplotVennBarplotTime]{DEplotVennBarplotTime()}}).
By temporal pattern, we mean the set of times ti such that the gene is
DE between ti and the reference time t0.
\item a similar UpSet plot where each bar is split in different colors
corresponding to all possible numbers of DE times where genes are over
expressed in a given temporal pattern.
\item a list (output \code{List.Glossary}) containing the glossary of
the column names of \code{DE.results}.
\item a list (output \code{Summary.Inputs}) containing a summary of sample
information and inputs of
\code{\link[=DEanalysisGlobal]{DEanalysisGlobal()}}.

conditions, the function returns

\itemize{
\item gene names
\item Results from the temporal statistical analysis
\itemize{

biological conditions for each fixed time.
\item \eqn{N_{bc}} binary columns (0 and 1), one per biological condition
(with \eqn{N_{bc}} the number of biological conditions).
A 1 in one of these two columns means the gene is DE at least between
one time ti versus the reference time t0, for the biological condition
associated to the given column.
\item \eqn{N_{bc}} columns, one per biological condition, where each
element is succession of 0 and 1. The positions of 1 in one of these
two columns, indicate the set of times ti such that the gene is DE
between ti and the reference time t0, for the biological condition
associated to the given column.

\itemize{
\item pvalues, log2 fold change and DE genes between each time ti

to the given column.
\item \eqn{T \times N_{bc}} binary columns, which give the genes specific
for each biological condition at each time ti.

biological conditions at time ti, but not DE between any pair of
other biological conditions at time ti.
\item \eqn{T \times N_{bc}} columns filled with -1, 0 and 1.

given biological condition BC1 at time ti if the gene is specific to
the biological condition BC1 at time ti and expressions in BC1 at time
ti are higher than in the other biological conditions at time ti.
A -1 in one of these columns means the gene is down-regulated

associated to the given column. A gene is called down-regulated for a
given biological condition at a time ti BC1 if the gene is specific to
the biological condition BC1 at time ti and expressions in BC1 at time
ti are lower than in the other biological conditions at time ti.
A 0 in one of these columns means the gene is not specific to the
biological condition at a fixed time associated to the given column.
