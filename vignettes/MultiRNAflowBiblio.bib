	abstract = {In comparative high-throughput sequencing assays, a fundamental task is the analysis of count data, such as read counts per gene in {RNA}-seq, for evidence of systematic changes across experimental conditions. Small replicate numbers, discreteness, large dynamic range and the presence of outliers require a suitable statistical approach. We present {DESeq}2, a method for differential analysis of count data, using shrinkage estimation for dispersions and fold changes to improve stability and interpretability of estimates. This enables a more quantitative analysis focused on the strength rather than the mere presence of differential expression. The {DESeq}2 package is available at http://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/{DESeq}2.html webcite.},

	abstract = {B-cell receptor ({BCR}) signaling is crucial for the pathophysiology of most mature B-cell lymphomas/leukemias and has emerged as a therapeutic target whose effectiveness remains limited by the occurrence of mutations. Therefore, deciphering the cellular program activated downstream this pathway has become of paramount importance for the development of innovative therapies. Using an original ex vivo model of {BCR}-induced proliferation of chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells, we generated 108 temporal transcriptional and proteomic profiles from 1&#8201;h up to 4 days after {BCR} activation. This dataset revealed a structured temporal response composed of 13,065 transcripts and 4027 proteins, comprising a leukemic proliferative signature consisting of 430 genes and 374 proteins. Mathematical modeling of this complex cellular response further highlighted a transcriptional network driven by 14 early genes linked to proteins involved in cell proliferation. This group includes expected genes ({EGR}1/2, {NF}-{kB}) and genes involved in {NF}-{kB} signaling modulation ({TANK}, {ROHF}) and immune evasion ({KMO}, {IL}4I1) that have not yet been associated with leukemic cells proliferation. Our study unveils the {BCR}-activated proliferative genetic program in primary leukemic cells. This approach combining temporal measurements with modeling allows identifying new putative targets for innovative therapy of lymphoid malignancies and also cancers dependent on ligandreceptor interactions.},

The method derives its power by focusing on gene sets, that is, groups of genes that share common biological function, chromosomal location, or regulation. We demonstrate how {GSEA} yields insights into several cancer-related data sets, including leukemia and lung cancer. Notably, where single-gene analysis finds little similarity between two independent studies of patient survival in lung cancer, {GSEA} reveals many biological pathways in common. The {GSEA} method is embodied in a freely available software package, together with an initial database of 1,325 biologically defined gene sets.},

All existing annotation types have been updated, if available, based on the new {DAVID} Gene system. Compared with the last version, the number of gene-term records for most annotation types within the updated Knowledgebase have significantly increased. Moreover, we have incorporated new annotations in the Knowledgebase including small molecule-gene interactions from {PubChem}, drug-gene interactions from {DrugBank}, tissue expression information from the Human Protein Atlas, disease information from {DisGeNET}, and pathways from {WikiPathways} and {PathBank}. Eight of ten subgroups split from Uniprot Keyword annotation were assigned to specific types. Finally, we added a species parameter for uploading a list of gene symbols to minimize the ambiguity between species, which increases the efficiency of the list upload and eliminates confusion for users.

	abstract = {The circadian clock and feeding rhythms are both important regulators of rhythmic gene expression in the liver. To further dissect the respective contributions of feeding and the clock, we analyzed differential rhythmicity of liver tissue samples across several conditions. We developed a statistical method tailored to compare rhythmic liver messenger {RNA} ({mRNA}) expression in mouse knockout models of multiple clock genes, as well as {PARbZip} output transcription factors (Hlf/Dbp/Tef ). Mice were exposed to ad libitum or night-restricted feeding under regular lightdark cycles. During ad libitum feeding, genetic ablation of the core clock attenuated rhythmic-feeding patterns, which could be restored by the night-restricted feeding regimen. High-amplitude {mRNA} expression rhythms in wild-type livers were driven by the circadian clock, but rhythmic feeding also contributed to rhythmic gene expression, albeit with significantly lower amplitudes. We observed that Bmal1 and Cry1/2 knockouts differed in their residual rhythmic gene expression. Differences in mean expression levels between wild types and knockouts correlated with rhythmic gene expression in wild type. Surprisingly, in {PARbZip} knockout mice, the mean expression levels of {PARbZip} targets were more strongly impacted than their rhythms, potentially due to the rhythmic activity of the D-boxrepressor {NFIL}3. Genes that lost rhythmicity in {PARbZip} knockouts were identified to be indirect targets. Our findings provide insights into the diurnal transcriptome in mouse liver as we identified the differential contributions of several core clock regulators. In addition, we gained more insights on the specific effects of the feedingfasting cycle.},

	abstract = {Measures of {RNA} abundance are important for many areas of biology and often obtained from high-throughput {RNA} sequencing methods such as Illumina sequence data. These measures need to be normalized to remove technical biases inherent in the sequencing approach, most notably the length of the {RNA} species and the sequencing depth of a sample. These biases are corrected in the widely used reads per kilobase per million reads ({RPKM}) measure. Here, we argue that the intended meaning of {RPKM} is a measure of relative molar {RNA} concentration (rmc) and show that for each set of transcripts the average rmc is a constant, namely the inverse of the number of transcripts mapped. Further, we show that {RPKM} does not respect this invariance property and thus cannot be an accurate measure of rmc. We propose a slight modification of {RPKM} that eliminates this inconsistency and call it {TPM} for transcripts per million. {TPM} respects the average invariance and eliminates statistical biases inherent in the {RPKM} measure.},

              Background
              {RNA} sequencing ({RNA}-seq) is an ever increasingly popular tool for transcriptome profiling. A key point to make the best use of the available data is to provide software tools that are easy to use but still provide flexibility and transparency in the adopted methods. Despite the availability of many packages focused on detecting differential expression, a method to streamline this type of bioinformatics analysis in a comprehensive, accessible, and reproducible way is lacking.
            
            
              Results
              We developed the  software package, which serves as a web application for interactive and reproducible {RNA}-seq analysis, while producing a wealth of visualizations to facilitate data interpretation.  is implemented in R using the Shiny framework, and is fully integrated with the existing core structures of the Bioconductor project. Users can perform the essential steps of the differential expression analysis workflow in an assisted way, and generate a broad spectrum of publication-ready outputs, including diagnostic and summary visualizations in each module, all the way down to functional analysis.  also offers the possibility to seamlessly generate a full {HTML} report for storing and sharing results together with code for reproducibility.

The primary goal is the detection of genes whose expression changes significantly between two or more conditions, either for a single species or for two or more interacting species at the same time (dual {RNA}-seq, triple {RNA}-seq and so forth). The analysis of {RNA}-seq can be simplified as many steps of the data pre-processing can be standardised in a pipeline.
In this publication we present the {GEO}2RNAseq pipeline for complete, quick and concurrent pre-processing of single, dual, and triple {RNA}-seq data. It covers all pre-processing steps starting from raw sequencing data to the analysis of differentially expressed genes, including various tables and figures to report intermediate and final results. Raw data may be provided in {FASTQ} format or can be downloaded automatically from the Gene Expression Omnibus repository. {GEO}2RNAseq strongly incorporates experimental as well as computational metadata. {GEO}2RNAseq is implemented in R, lightweight, easy to install via Conda and easy to use, but still very flexible through using modular programming and offering many extensions and alternative workflows.
{GEO}2RNAseq is publicly available at https://anaconda.org/xentrics/r-geo2rnaseq and https://bitbucket.org/thomas\wolf/geo2rnaseq/overview, including source code, installation instruction, and comprehensive package documentation.},

How oncogenic {NOTCH}1 signaling launches a leukemia-prone chromatin landscape during T-{ALL} initiation is unknown. Here we demonstrate an essential role for the high-mobility-group transcription factor Tcf1 in orchestrating chromatin accessibility and topology, allowing aberrant Notch1 signaling to convey its oncogenic function. Although essential, Tcf1 is not sufficient to initiate leukemia. The formation of a leukemia-prone epigenetic landscape at the distal Notch1-regulated Myc enhancer, which is fundamental to this disease, is Tcf1-dependent and occurs within the earliest progenitor stage even before cells adopt a T lymphocyte or leukemic fate. Moreover, we discovered a unique evolutionarily conserved Tcf1-regulated enhancer element in the distal Myc-enhancer, which is important for the transition of preleukemic cells to full-blown disease.},

	abstract = {Clustering is an important tool in microarray data analysis. This unsupervised learning technique is commonly used to reveal structures hidden in large gene expression data sets. The vast majority of clustering algorithms applied so far produce hard partitions of the data, i.e. each gene is assigned exactly to one cluster. Hard clustering is favourable if clusters are well separated. However, this is generally not the case for microarray time-course data, where gene clusters frequently overlap. Additionally, hard clustering algorithms are often highly sensitive to noise.
To overcome the limitations of hard clustering, we applied soft clustering which offers several advantages for researchers. First, it generates accessible internal cluster structures, i.e. it indicates how well corresponding clusters represent genes. This can be used for the more targeted search for regulatory elements. Second, the overall relation between clusters, and thus a global clustering structure, can be defined. Additionally, soft clustering is more noise robust and a priori pre-filtering of genes can be avoided. This prevents the exclusion of biologically relevant genes from the data analysis. Soft clustering was implemented here using the fuzzy c-means algorithm. Procedures to find optimal clustering parameters were developed. A software package for soft clustering has been developed based on the open-source statistical language R. The package called Mfuzz is freely available.},

	abstract = {In recent years, {RNA}-sequencing ({RNA}-seq) has emerged as a powerful technology for transcriptome profiling. For a given gene, the number of mapped reads is not only dependent on its expression level and gene length, but also the sequencing depth. To normalize these dependencies, {RPKM} (reads per kilobase of transcript per million reads mapped) and {TPM} (transcripts per million) are used to measure gene or transcript expression levels. A common misconception is that {RPKM} and {TPM} values are already normalized, and thus should be comparable across samples or {RNA}-seq projects. However, {RPKM} and {TPM} represent the relative abundance of a transcript among a population of sequenced transcripts, and therefore depend on the composition of the {RNA} population in a sample. Quite often, it is reasonable to assume that total {RNA} concentration and distributions are very close across compared samples. Nevertheless, the sequenced {RNA} repertoires may differ significantly under different experimental conditions and/or across sequencing protocols; thus, the proportion of gene expression is not directly comparable in such cases. In this review, we illustrate typical scenarios in which {RPKM} and {TPM} are misused, unintentionally, and hope to raise scientists awareness of this issue when comparing them across samples or different sequencing protocols.},

SeqGSEA implements an analysis pipeline, which first computes differential splicing and differential expression scores, followed by integrating them into a per-gene score that quantifies each gene's association with a phenotype of interest, and finally executes gene set enrichment analysis in a cutoff-free manner to achieve biological insights. SeqGSEA accounts for biological variability and determines the statistical significance of gene pathways and networks using subject permutation, and thus requires at least five samples per group. Real applications show that SeqGSEA detects more biologically meaningful gene sets without biases toward long or highly expressed genes. SeqGSEA can be set up to run in parallel to reduce the analysis time.
