#' @title Mouse raw counts data
#'
#' @description There are 4 groups : samples with or without hyper activation
#' of the gene NOTTCH1 (N1ha versus N1wt) and with or without knock out
#' of the gene TCF1 (T1ko versus T1wt).
#' The original dataset has 39017 genes but we kept only 500 genes
#' in order to increase the speed of each function in our algorithm.
#'
#' @format A data frame with 500 rows (genes) and 13 columns (samples).
#' The column names are as follow

#' @details
#' The following is quoted from the GEO series GSE169116 (link in source):
#'
#' Summary :
#' "NOTCH1 is a well-established lineage specifier for T cells and
#' among the most frequently mutated genes throughout all subclasses of T cell
#' acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL).
#' How oncogenic NOTCH1 signaling launches a leukemia-prone chromatin landscape
#' during T-ALL initiation is unknown. Here we demonstrate an essential role
#' for the high-mobility-group transcription factor Tcf1
#' in orchestrating chromatin accessibility and topology allowing for aberrant
#' Notch1 signaling to convey its oncogenic function.
#' Although essential, Tcf1 is not sufficient to initiate leukemia.
#' The formation of a leukemia-prone landscape at the distal Notch1-regulated
#' Myc enhancer, which is fundamental to this disease, is Tcf1-dependent and
#' occurs within the earliest progenitor stage even before cells adopt
#' a T lymphocyte or leukemic fate.
#' Moreover, we discovered an additional evolutionarily conserved
#' Tcf1-regulated enhancer element, in the distal Myc-enhancer,
#' which is important for the transition of pre-leukemic cells
#' to full-blown disease."
#'
#' Overall design:
#' "Expression profile comparisons of sorted LSK derived from C57BL/6J;
#' Sv/129 compound mice with Notch1 induced or Tcf1 knocked-down."
#'
#' We kept 500 genes only in order to increase the speed for each example.
